              <h4>Tokyo</h4>
              <p>
                Tokyo is a city of contrasts, where neon-lit skyscrapers tower
                above centuries-old shrines and bustling markets. Dive into the
                electric energy of Shibuya Crossing, then slip into quiet
                alleyways for hidden izakayas and ramen counters. A must-do
                experience here is visiting the buzzing Tsukiji Outer Market,
                where you can taste the freshest sushi and street snacks while
                soaking in the city’s unstoppable rhythm. Every corner feels
                like a new world; futuristic, chaotic, and irresistibly alive.
                For a perfect city escape, stroll through the peaceful gardens
                of the Imperial Palace.

              <h4>Kyoto</h4>
              <p>
                Kyoto is Japan’s timeless heart, where ancient temples, tranquil
                gardens, and lantern-lit alleyways blend seamlessly with modern
                life. A must-do experience here is exploring the enchanting
                Fushimi Inari Shrine, famous for its endless rows of vermilion
                torii gates that wind up the sacred Mount Inari. Walking through
                this glowing tunnel feels like stepping into another world—equal
                parts spiritual journey. Whether you linger in the serene hush
                of the forested trails or capture the iconic gates at golden
                hour, this is the essence of Kyoto you’ll never forget.

              <h4>Nara</h4>
              <p>
                Nara is where Japan’s ancient spirit comes alive, blending vast
                parks, wooden temples, and free-roaming deer. The city’s star
                attraction is Todai-ji Temple, home to the Great Buddha, an
                awe-inspiring bronze giant housed in the world’s largest wooden
                hall. Beyond the temple, deer wander through Nara Park, bowing
                politely (and sometimes cheekily demanding snacks) for crackers.
                The mix of sacred calm and playful wildlife makes Nara
                unforgettable. It’s an easy day trip from Kyoto, yet it feels
                like stepping centuries back in time.

              <h4>Hiroshima</h4>
              <p>
                Hiroshima is a city of resilience, rebuilt from tragedy into a
                vibrant, forward-looking hub. The Peace Memorial Park and Museum
                is a moving reminder of history, offering a sobering yet
                essential experience. But Hiroshima is not only about
                remembrance—it’s also alive with riverside walks, bustling
                nightlife, and hearty local food. Be sure to try Hiroshima-style
                okonomiyaki, a layered pancake dish grilled right in front of
                you. Few cities balance sorrow and hope with such grace.

              <h4>Miyajima</h4>
              <p>
                Just a short ferry ride from Hiroshima lies Miyajima, a small
                island that feels almost mythical. Its centerpiece is the
                floating torii gate of Itsukushima Shrine, which seems to rise
                straight out of the sea at high tide. Beyond the iconic view,
                the island offers forested hiking trails up Mount Misen, with
                sweeping panoramas across the Inland Sea. Street stalls tempt
                you with grilled oysters and maple-leaf shaped cakes, local
                specialties. Miyajima radiates a calm, otherworldly beauty that
                lingers long after you leave.

              <h4>Osaka</h4>
              <p>
                Osaka is Japan’s kitchen—loud, colorful, and full of flavor. The
                neon-drenched streets of Dotonbori are the perfect stage to
                feast on takoyaki, skewers, and fluffy okonomiyaki straight from
                sizzling griddles. The city has a playful, welcoming vibe, less
                polished than Tokyo but equally magnetic. By day, explore Osaka
                Castle and riverside parks; by night, dive into the buzzing
                nightlife where laughter spills into the streets. Osaka is the
                place to eat, drink, and let loose before your journey ends.
